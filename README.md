Vidual_analytics
----------------

The Vidual_analytics package will provide data analysis functions for the structured and semi-structured data that will be collected from the Vidual website. As it is built as a package, it can be loaded into an R session or called from RScript in a bash script.

The goal is to provide useful data processing tools for transforming data, validating data, and developing insights from user-collected data.

## Functions

The `listing_data_to_JSON` function will take data collected from fields, perform validation and QA/QC for the collected data, and produce a JSON file.
